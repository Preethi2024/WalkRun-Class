# WalkRun-Class
the data analysis report involved both univariate and bivariate analyses of the provided dataset. These analyses likely included examining individual variables for trends and relationships between pairs of variables.

For the predictive modeling task, four different models were created to classify whether a person is running or walking based on the predictor variables. These models were evaluated for accuracy, and it was found that the GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) model outperformed the others in predicting the classes. Additionally, it was observed that the prediction accuracy on the testing data improved when using a window size greater than 1, indicating the importance of considering temporal patterns in the data.

Overall, the analysis and modeling efforts provided valuable insights into the dataset and yielded a predictive model with satisfactory performance for classifying activities based on the given data.
